pyMongoAdmin
=========

A simple, pythonic admin interface for MongoDB.

Installation instructions:

pyMongoAdmin depends on two python libraries, flask and pymongo. 
Install these in whichever way you prefer before continuing with the installation 
process. After flask and pymongo are installed, run the install.py script from the 
command line. The script will ask you to input some information. Afterwards, the 
installation is complete, and you can run pyMongoAdmin by executing mongoadmin.py. 

Note: pyMongoAdmin is only meant to be used to manage MongoDB instances running in
a trusted environment.

User guide is available in doc/. You can also read it in the application
by going to /doc/.
